# Two-Gesture Recognizer
Train and deploy a gesture recognizer neural net using Tensorflow with 500 32x32 images of each gesture.
The network is a 3-layer network with 2 hidden layers and it uses stochastic gradient descent and constant learning rate.
Training images were generated using OpenCV to capture 500 frames of each gesture with minor variation from moving around the camera field of view. See folders /one and /two.
